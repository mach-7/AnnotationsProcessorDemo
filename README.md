# AnnotationsProcessorDemo
A demo project that shows how we can create custom annotations and write annotation processors to augment the client code
Here we demonstrate the use of custom annotation and annotation processor written with JavaPoet. As an example, a User POJO is annotated with @builder annotation, which is our custom annotation that provides a UserBuilder class at runtime, to enable a builder pattern for the User objects.
